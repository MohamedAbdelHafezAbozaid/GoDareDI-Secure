// Compiled GoDareDI Binary Framework
// Source code is protected and encrypted in this binary
// This is a demonstration of what a compiled binary looks like
// In a real implementation, this would be a proper Mach-O binary

// The actual implementation is hidden and protected
// External developers cannot see the source code
// Only the public API is accessible through the headers
