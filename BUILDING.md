# Building the Binary Framework

## Current Status

This distribution package is prepared for binary framework distribution. To complete the process:

### Option 1: Manual Xcode Build (Recommended)

1. Open the GoDareDI project in Xcode
2. Create a new Framework target
3. Build for all platforms (iOS, iOS Simulator, macOS)
4. Create XCFramework using Xcode's built-in tools
5. Replace the target in Package.swift with a binary target

### Option 2: Automated Build Script

Use the provided build scripts:
- `build-xcframework.sh` - Creates XCFramework using Xcode
- `create-binary-framework.sh` - Alternative approach

### Option 3: CI/CD Pipeline

Set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and release binary frameworks.

## Next Steps

1. Build the actual binary framework
2. Update Package.swift to use binary target
3. Deploy to GitHub repository
4. Update Web Dashboard with new repository URL

## Security Benefits

Once the binary framework is built:
- Source code will be compiled and protected
- Only public headers will be exposed
- Full functionality will be available to developers
- Intellectual property will be protected
